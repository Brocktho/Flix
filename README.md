### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Challenges were having pods not work correctly so i had to reinstall ruby with some help from other sources, and my gif not working because the content limit was reached for the gif, re-recorded it faster, don't feel like this gif really does much or at least won't for future apps cause you can only show at most 2 seconds. I attached a screenshot of the app running on my personal device. It's the last picture if it wasn't clear.
